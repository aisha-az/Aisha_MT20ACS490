Description:
Ursnif Trojan is a dangerous malware that can collect the system activity of the victims, record keystrokes, and keep track of network traffic and browser activity. The malware stores the data in an archive before sending it to the C2.

The malware uses malicious Microsoft Office documents to get into the usersâ€™ machine and requires macros to be activated. Once opened, the document will prompt the user to enable macros. If the user plays along with the instruction, the malware drops a VB script into the temp directory of the current user, upon which it is automatically decoded, and the malicious payload is downloaded.

Behavior:
Malware arrives as a weaponized Office document	
Victim is lured into opening the attachment and enabling malicious macro
Downloaded document has obfuscated macros to hide URLs hosting the malware
